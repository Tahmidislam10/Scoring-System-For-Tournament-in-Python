# scoring-system-for-tournament
I've created a tournament scoring system for a college. Participants can enter individually or as part of a team. Expecting four teams with five members each and 20 spaces for individual competitors. Each participant competes in five diverse events, earning points based on their rank. The system also allows for entering just one event.
